Revision history for IO-Async-Loop-AnyEvent

0.03    CHANGES:
         * Updated to cope with AnyEvent version 6 - one_event renamed to _poll
         * Try to defer loading IO::Async::Loop, whose presence can confuse
           AnyEvent and cause it to get into a cyclic IO::Async<->AnyEvent
           dependency loop at runtime

0.02    CHANGES:
         * Implement ->watch_idle and ->unwatch_idle. Observe a bug that it
           doesn't work correctly on nested IO::Async-AnyEvent-IO::Async cases
         * Added unit tests that demonstrate mixed IO::Async + AnyEvent event
           handling works correctly

0.01    First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
